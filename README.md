## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.9 or higher

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamuelMaiko/academic-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd academic-backend
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   - **In Linux**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

   - **In Windows**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   env\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. [Set up the environment variables](#environment-configuration)

6. Set up the database:

   - **For development purposes**, you can use SQLite. Ensure your `settings.py` file has the following configuration commented/uncommented accordingly:

     ```python
     # settings.py

     #Use this for development with SQLite

      DATABASES = {
          'default': {
              'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
              'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
          }
      }


     ```

   - **For production purposes**, configure the environment variables in your `.env` file:

```bash
   #Use this for production with PostgreSQL

      DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
             'NAME': config('DATABASE_NAME'),
             'USER': config('DATABASE_USER'),
             'PASSWORD': config('DATABASE_PASSWORD'),
             'HOST': config('DATABASE_HOST'),
             'PORT': config('DATABASE_PORT', default='5432'),
         }
     }

```

```dotenv
DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name
DATABASE_USER=your_database_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DATABASE_HOST=your_database_host
DATABASE_PORT=your_database_port
```

7. Create a superuser for admin access:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Environment Configuration

Before running the project, you need to set up your environment variables. Follow these steps:

1. Copy the example environment variables file to create your own `.env` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open the `.env` file In **VS code**,

   **OR**

   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

3. Fill in your own configuration details. Hereâ€™s an explanation of each variable:

   ```dotenv
   # .env

   DEBUG=True  # Set to False in production
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

   # Postgres Database configuration for production
   DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name
   DATABASE_USER=your_database_user
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   DATABASE_HOST=your_database_host
   DATABASE_PORT=your_database_port

   # Email settings
   EMAIL_BACKEND=your_email_backend
   EMAIL_HOST=your_email_host
   EMAIL_PORT=your_email_port  # Preferably use 465 for SSL
   EMAIL_USE_TLS=False  # Set to True if using TLS
   EMAIL_USE_SSL=True
   EMAIL_HOST_USER=your_email_user
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your_email_password


   # Additional settings
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
   ```

## Usage

1. Access the development server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
2. Use API endpoints to interact with the portal (e.g., login, create work, uptake work, submit work).

## Planned Features

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Implement real-time updates using WebSockets to keep users informed about new assignments and notifications instantly.

- **In-App Chat System**: Develop a messaging system to facilitate communication between writers and admins directly within the application.

- **Teams Functionality**: Introduce team-based features allowing work to be assigned and managed collaboratively within groups.

- **Background Tasks**: Utilize Celery for handling asynchronous tasks, such as sending bulk notifications or processing long-running operations

## Known Issues

### 1. Database Configuration

- **Description:** The application is still using SQLite for the database and has not been connected to a hosted database.
- **Status:** Migration to a hosted database is planned
- **Workaround:** For development purposes, SQLite is sufficient. For production, please configure a PostgreSQL database as described in the [Installation](#installation) section.

### 2. Notifications

- **Description:** The application has not setup notifications in all necessary routes.

- **Status:** few endpoints have notifications e.g uptake work,revoke work ...

### 3. Serving Media

- **Description:** The application has not setup external file storage and handling.

- **Status:** Planning on integrating Cloudinary for serving media.
